# Code book for Coursera *Getting and Cleaning Data* Coursera Course

This code book defines data contained in the `Samsung-SummarizedData.txt` file which is generated by running the `run_analysis.R` file contained in this repository.

See the `README.md` file (also contained in this repository) for details of how to generate the data set.

The structure of the data set is described in the [Data](#data) section while the content is defined in the [Variables](#variables) section.

## Data <a name="data"></a>

The `Samsung-SummarizedData.txt` data file is a text file, containing space-separated values.

The first row contains the names of the variables, which are listed and described in the [Variables](#variables) section.  The following rows contain the values of these variables.

Each row presented is actually the average of measurements for each Activity and Subject combination in the larger data set.

## Variables <a name="variables"></a>

Variables consist of [Identifies](#identifiers) and [Measures](#measures).

### Identifiers <a name="identifiers"></a>
Each row is identified by the combination of Activity (the action performed by the subject) and the test Subject.  In other words, data is summarized by the 6 Activities (defined below) and 30 Subjects (defined below).  As such, there are 180 data rows showing the Activity results for each of the Subjects.

#### Activity <a name="activity"></a>
    Represents the activities performed by the subjects.
	- `WALKING`: subject was walking
	- `WALKING_UPSTAIRS`: subject was walking upstairs
	- `WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS`: subject was walking downstairs
	- `SITTING`: subject was sitting
	- `STANDING`: subject was standing
	- `LAYING`: subject was laying

#### Subject <a name="subject"></a>
	Subject identifier - integer, ranges from 1 to 30.

### Measurements <a name="measurements"></a>

All measurements are floating-point values, normalised and bounded within [-1,1].

The measurements are classified in two domains:

- Time-domain signals (variables prefixed by `Time`), resulting from the capture of accelerometer and gyroscope raw signals.

- Frequency-domain signals (variables prefixed by `Frequency`), resulting from the application of a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to some of the time-domain signals.
